      <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When you step into Macaw, whether in Chennai or Bengaluru, you instantly feel it—the ambiance, the energy, the escape. But behind the cocktails and city lights lies a carefully curated design philosophy, one that transforms our rooftops into immersive, tropical sanctuaries.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          This is the story behind how Macaw became more than just a nightlife destination—it became a tropical experience.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌴 Rooted in Nature, Elevated by Design</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          From the very beginning, we envisioned Macaw as an urban escape—a space where the vibrancy of nature could live in harmony with the pulse of the city. Inspired by the colorful elegance of the macaw bird, we chose tropical design elements to echo its bold, free-spirited energy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">Every detail was chosen to reflect that ethos:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground">
          <li>Lush greenery that wraps around corners and climbs across railings</li>
          <li>Natural wood finishes that warm the space without overpowering it</li>
          <li>Tropical color palettes—deep greens, sunset oranges, ocean blues—that transport you instantly</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-8">
          The result? A space that feels alive, refreshing, and completely detached from the city below.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">✨ Luxury in the Details</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          While nature sets the tone, it’s luxury that sets Macaw apart. We layered in premium textures and refined finishes—from plush seating and custom lighting to polished metal accents and artisanal decor.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our lighting is ambient by design, glowing like twilight and letting the skyline take center stage. Every corner is Instagram-worthy but also intimate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          It’s not just design—it’s storytelling. Each material and finish was chosen to make guests feel comfortable, confident, and indulgent.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🔊 Sonic Ambiance: Designed to Move You</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A tropical paradise is not just about what you see—it's about what you hear. At Macaw, sound is a design layer. Our curated soundscapes—from slow grooves during sunset to high-energy beats as the night builds—are matched to the flow of the evening.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Sound design is engineered to wrap around you, not overpower you, making space for both conversation and celebration. Whether it’s the bass drop during Desi Night or the mellow vibe of Acoustic Sundays, every beat is part of the spatial experience.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🪴 Function Meets Flow</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We’ve also paid close attention to the movement and flow of people through our space. From the positioning of the bar to the dance floor layout, every element is intentionally designed to support effortless transitions between lounging, dining, and dancing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Our rooftop layouts were built for discovery—no two corners feel the same, and that’s the magic.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🏙️ Two Cities, One Escape</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">Despite being in two different cities, both Macaw rooftops maintain a consistent design language while celebrating their own character:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground">
          <li>Macaw by Stories – Chennai leans into ocean breeze and openness, with a spacious layout perfect for groups and live events.</li>
          <li>Macaw – Bengaluru embraces intimacy with a boutique rooftop layout and sleek modern finishes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-8">
          What unites them? The escape they offer—up, above, and beyond.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌟 Final Sip</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At Macaw, design isn’t just a backdrop—it’s a core part of the story. It’s the reason our spaces feel effortlessly chic, wildly alive, and endlessly memorable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          So next time you walk in, pause and take a look around. That palm leaf overhead? That golden light spilling onto your cocktail? They’re all part of the paradise we built for you.

          At Macaw, our sushi is more than a plate—it’s a performance. Hand-crafted with precision by our culinary team, each roll balances freshness, texture, and flavor, designed to pair beautifully with our tropical cocktails and rooftop vibe.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Whether you’re a purist or a flavor explorer, our signature platters offer something unforgettable for every palate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🍣 The Macaw Signature Platter</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          A curated selection of guest favorites—perfect for sharing. Expect a balanced mix of classics and house specials, presented with pickled ginger, wasabi, and chef’s seasonal garnishes.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-8">
          <li><strong>California Roll:</strong> Crab, avocado, cucumber—clean, creamy, and timeless.</li>
          <li><strong>Spicy Tuna Roll:</strong> A gentle kick with silky tuna and chili mayo.</li>
          <li><strong>Veggie Crunch Roll:</strong> Tempura vegetables, avocado, and a sesame finish.</li>
          <li><strong>Chef’s Nigiri:</strong> Daily fish selection, torched or raw, brushed with tare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🔥 Torched Truffle Salmon Roll</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Crowd-pleaser alert. We layer salmon over a creamy roll, kiss it with a quick torch, then finish with truffle oil and chives. Rich, aromatic, and melt-in-the-mouth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Pair it with: <em>Skyline Sour</em>—the citrus cuts through the richness beautifully.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌶️ Volcano Prawn Tempura Roll</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Crispy prawn tempura rolled with avocado and tobiko, topped with a warm, spicy mayo “volcano” glaze. Texture meets umami in every bite.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Pair it with: <em>Macaw Mule</em>—ginger spice complements the heat.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌿 Garden Dragon (Vegetarian)</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          A vibrant roll of cucumber, asparagus, and avocado topped with thin sheets of charred bell pepper and sesame. Light, clean, and addictive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Pair it with: <em>Feathered Mojito</em>—mint and lime echo the freshness.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">✨ The Experience, The Ritual</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          We serve sushi the way it’s meant to be enjoyed—beautifully plated, thoughtfully paced, and always fresh. Our chefs source high-quality ingredients and finish each platter with microgreens, yuzu, or togarashi for that final flourish.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Pro Tip: Ask for the <strong>Chef’s Seasonal Roll</strong>—a rotating creation inspired by peak produce and flavor trends.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">📸 Picture-Perfect Platters</h2>

        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
          At Macaw, entertainment isn’t just part of the night—it is the night. Across our rooftops in Chennai and Bengaluru, we’ve curated a distinct rhythm that turns casual evenings into legendary memories. From live music to electrifying DJ sets, our entertainment strategy is all about vibe, energy, and experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">This is how we design the perfect night—on the roof, under the stars.</p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🎧 Curated Beats for Every Mood</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Music is the heartbeat of Macaw. Whether you’re sipping cocktails at sunset or turning up after dark, we make sure the soundtrack fits the moment.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-6">
          <li><strong>Early Evenings:</strong> Expect chill lounge vibes, lo-fi beats, or acoustic sets to ease you into the evening. It’s about atmosphere—setting the tone, not stealing the show.</li>
          <li><strong>Peak Hours:</strong> This is where we turn it up. Live DJs drop commercial, desi, and deep house sets—crafted to get you on your feet and keep the energy flowing.</li>
          <li><strong>Special Nights:</strong> Watch out for theme nights like Desi Thursdays, Techno Fridays, or Sundowner Sessions, each curated with its own unique sound identity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">Why it matters: Every rooftop has a view—but not every rooftop knows how to make it move.</p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🕺 Designed for Dance and Discovery</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Entertainment at Macaw isn’t just about what you hear—it’s also about how you move. Both locations are designed with flow in mind, blending dance zones with intimate lounges and bar-side action. This gives guests the freedom to vibe how they want.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-6">
          <li><strong>Dance Floors:</strong> Strategically placed for maximum energy, yet never intrusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Live Acts:</strong> Occasionally, our rooftops host local artists, bands, and performers, transforming the space into a full-blown showcase.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Events:</strong> From open-mic nights to curated brand collabs, we keep it dynamic and fresh.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🎨 Visual Atmosphere that Moves with You</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Our rooftop spaces aren’t static—they react with the night. Using dynamic lighting, visuals, and decor, we create immersive zones that evolve from mellow to electric as the night unfolds.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-6">
          <li><strong>Lighting Design:</strong> Warm ambient tones early on, transitioning into rhythmic LED and club-style visuals later in the evening.</li>
          <li><strong>Photo Moments:</strong> Instagrammable spots (neon signs, art walls, skyline shots) are part of the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Soundscapes:</strong> Our sound systems are calibrated to deliver immersive audio while keeping conversation-friendly corners.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🎟️ Events You’ll Actually Want to Attend</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
          We’re constantly evolving our calendar with seasonal specials, brand collabs, and community-driven celebrations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-2">Recurring Highlights Include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-6">
          <li>Desi Night (Chennai & Bengaluru)</li>
          <li>Live Artist Showcases</li>
          <li>Themed Brunch Parties</li>
          <li>Private Rooftop Takeovers for Brands & Influencers</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Customizable for Groups:</strong> Whether it’s a corporate party or birthday bash, we can tailor entertainment to suit your crowd—DJs, live performers, special menus and more.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌆 One Brand, Two Vibes</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-2">
          Though united by the Macaw spirit, each city brings its own flavor to the entertainment:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground mb-6">
          <li>Macaw Chennai leans into its ocean-side setting with relaxed sundowners that build into high-energy dance nights.</li>
          <li>Macaw Bengaluru offers a more urban, boutique-style experience with curated sets, tighter zones, and themed nights that pack a punch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">No matter where you party, Macaw brings the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2 className="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">🌟 The Takeaway</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Entertainment at Macaw is not a backdrop—it’s the star of the show. We don’t just play music or host DJs—we create immersive rooftop journeys that leave you buzzing long after last call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
          So whether you’re here to dance, vibe, or discover something new—just look up. The rooftop’s calling.
